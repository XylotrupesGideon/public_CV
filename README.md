### University Engagement

**Alumni teach useful skills; Workshop series**<br>
I organized and taught multiple workshops for master students in which former students of the developmental and stem cell biology major program taught valuable skills they learned during or after their master studies to the younger students.

**Major Studies Student Speaker** _(October 2016 - April 2019)_<br>
As Major speaker I represented the students of the developmental and stem cell biology major. In this function I also helped to organize the BioSpective talk series showcased career options in and outside of academia.

**First Aid Helper** _(2020 - Present)_ <br>
I have been a first aid helper for my department since 2020.

### Social Engagement outside of university

**Administrator/Head of Staff** @[Build the Earth](https://buildtheearth.net) _(January 2021 - today)_<br>
The Build the Earth gaming community is an international online community with ~170.000 members. They are dedicated to replicate the whole earth at 1:1 scale in the computer game Minecraft and thereby make the whole world accessible for any child that owns the game for free. As head of staff I am the responsible Human Resources manager for the team of ~100 volunteers. I am also one of the three main administrators that act as senior management for the overall project who deal with strategic and business decisions.

**Voluntary social service year** @[ICYE/Uganda Volunteers for Peace](https://www.icye.org/icye-in-the-world/uganda/) _(August 2011 - August 2012)_<br>
For my volunteer social service year I went to Uganda to work at the Kiyumbakimu Childrens Village, home for AIDS-orphans. Sponsored by a "weltwärts" scholarship. [[Certificate-German]](./Certificates/Zertifikat_ICJA.pdf)

**Co-founder** @[Masaka Street Children Project](https://masakastreetchildren.wordpress.com) _(since 2012)_<br>
While I was in Uganda for my social volunteer service I aided a few Ugandan friends to found a small orphanage project which helps street children to attend primary schools.

## Hobbies

**Drawing/Crafting** - I especially enjoy drawing animals in nature or at the zoo. I especially enjoy the required attention to details, good observation skills and patience.

**Foraging for mushrooms** - A good way to get out into nature and learn about the world around us. Also the systematic identification of edible mushrooms requires analytical thinking and again close attention to details.

**Swimming/Bouldering** - Is my cool down excercise after long work days and a great way of meditating and practicing mindfullness while also moving.
